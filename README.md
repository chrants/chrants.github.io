# Christian Tschoepe (Resumé)

This is my resumé and experience as a Software Engineer and Full-Stack Developer

This project was designed to upgrade my old, boring Word Resume to the 21st Century and will act as its replacement.

You can even save the website as a PDF or print it as a resume directly in the browser! Select "background graphics" in the browser's print dialog.

**Technologies used:**

- `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
- `AngularJS`
- `Angular-Material`
- `Bootstrap 4`

Many of my projects are not on GitHub publicly as I might want to grow them into a company one day. For more projects not listed here, please contact me at the contacts listed on my website.
