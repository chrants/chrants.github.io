# Christian Tschoepe (Resumé)

This project was designed to upgrade my old, boring Word Resume to the 21st Century and will act as its replacement. 

You can even save the website as a PDF or print it as a resume directly in the browser! Select "no margins" and "background graphics" in the browser's print dialog.
