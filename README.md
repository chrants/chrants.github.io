# Christian Tschoepe (Resumé)

This project was designed to upgrade my old, boring Word Resume to the 21st Century and will act as its replacement. 

You can even save the website as a PDF or print it as a resume directly in the browser! Select "background graphics" in the browser's print dialog.

Many of my projects are not on GitHub publicly as I might want to grow them into a company one day. For more projects not listed here, please contact me at the contacts listed on my website.
